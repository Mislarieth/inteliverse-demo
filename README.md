# inteliverse-demo v1
A distributed, mutable, peer-to-peer public knowledge network

Uses cryptico and peerjs

Think if the IPFS is the hard drive of the Internet, Inteliverse (pMoment?) is the RAM.

Inteliverse/pMoment/NOW/Push/Force/Karma/Science/RAM/Path/GOD/Faith/Trust/Life/Lives/Kindness acts as a block of data being hosted by multiple members of a network.  For one to access a block, it must first prove that it is hosting a block of data in the network and continue proving it throughout connection to host.  

It should have zero footprint.  It should be a set chunk of data.  It should be lightweight.

It should only have what it knows now, in the present moment.  Once the data is gone, it's gone.


Inteliverse is organized on layers; to access each layer of blocks, one must prove that it is a host on that layer.

Each block has a list of objects containing publicly accepted data, the owner of that data, and the data itself.
Each block knows its index and its neighbor's indicies.  In order to add a block to the chain, one must must first prove that it is hosting that block.

A block contains the public IP:Port of the location that served it, a list of hosts of this data (IP:Port), the IP:Port of the previous value in the list of data, the IP:Port of the next value in the list of data, as well as the data itself.  

The data itself contains its ID, the owner/s of this data, as well
